          <p>
            In computer network communications, <strong>HTTP 404</strong> is an error
            message indicating that the browser was able to communicate with a given
            server, but the server could not find what was requested.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike a "Server Not Found" error (which means the connection failed
            entirely), a 404 means the connection is fine, but the specific page
            or file is missing.
