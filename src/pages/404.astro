      <p>
        In computer network communications, <strong>HTTP 404</strong> is an error
        message indicating that the browser was able to communicate with a given server,
        but the server could not find what was requested.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike a "Server Not Found" error (which means the connection failed
        entirely), a 404 means the connection is fine, but the specific page or
        file is missing.
      </p>
